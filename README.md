# Planetary Systems Study and Simulation

## Project Description
This project explores the vast possibilities of conducting scientific research within the cosmos, focusing on the planets and their mathematical-physical relationships. Our goal is to utilize these relationships to model the geometric configurations of planets and analyze their spatial distances.

## Objectives
- **Geometric Alignment Analysis**: Determine the time intervals at which planets align into specific geometric shapes and analyze the areas of these shapes formed by various planetary configurations.
- **Planetary Conjunctions**: Perform calculations to identify times when it is possible for the planets in the system to align linearly.

## Tools Used
- **Julia Language**: For efficient computation and data handling.
- **Plots Library**: To visualize data and geometric configurations of the planets.
